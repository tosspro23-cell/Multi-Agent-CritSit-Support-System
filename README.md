# Multi-Agent-CritSit-Support-System
This project introduces a multi-agent collaboration framework for managing critical situation (CritSit) cases in enterprise environments. Instead of relying on a single monolithic agent, this system leverages specialized agents that each focus on a distinct aspect of case handling â€” while working together in a shared context.
